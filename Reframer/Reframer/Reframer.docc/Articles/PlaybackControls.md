# Playback Controls

Navigate through video with frame-accurate precision.

## Overview

Reframer provides precise control over video playback, letting you step through footage frame by frame or scrub quickly through the timeline.

## Play and Pause

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Keyboard | Press **Space** |
| Control bar | Click the **▶** / **⏸** button |

## Frame Stepping

Move through video one frame at a time for precise positioning.

### Scroll Wheel

When the window is unlocked, scroll the mouse wheel on the video:

- **Scroll up** — Previous frame
- **Scroll down** — Next frame

### Global Shortcuts

These work even when another app is active:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Previous frame | **⌘ Page Up** |
| Next frame | **⌘ Page Down** |
| Back 10 frames | **⌘ Shift Page Up** |
| Forward 10 frames | **⌘ Shift Page Down** |

## Timeline Scrubbing

Drag the timeline slider to jump to any point in the video. The slider shows your position from start to end.

## Frame Input

For precise navigation, type the exact frame number:

1. Click the frame counter in the control bar
2. Type the frame number
3. Press **Enter** to jump to that frame

Use arrow keys while the field is focused:

- **↑ / ↓** — Step by 1 frame
- **Shift ↑ / ↓** — Step by 10 frames

## Frame Display

The overlay in the upper-left corner shows:

```
Frame 142 / 720
```

This tells you the current frame and total frames in the video.

## Audio

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Toggle mute | Click the **speaker** icon |

Audio is muted by default to avoid interrupting your work.
