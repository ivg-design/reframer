# Lock Mode

Click through the video to interact with apps below.

## Overview

Lock mode makes the video overlay completely non-interactive. Mouse clicks pass through to whatever app is underneath, letting you work normally while the video stays visible as a reference.

## Toggling Lock Mode

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Keyboard | Press **L** |
| Control bar | Click the **lock** icon |
| Global shortcut | Press **⌘ Shift L** (works from any app) |

## What Lock Mode Does

### When Locked

- Clicks pass through the video to apps below
- Window cannot be moved or resized
- Zoom and pan are disabled
- Control bar remains interactive
- A lock indicator appears in the corner

### When Unlocked

- Video responds to mouse interaction
- Window can be moved and resized
- Zoom, pan, and scroll controls work
- Full mouse interaction available

## Lock Indicator

When locked, a small lock icon appears in the overlay to remind you the window is in lock mode.

## Control Bar Access

The control bar always remains interactive, even when locked. This lets you:

- Adjust playback (play, pause, step frames)
- Change opacity
- Toggle lock off
- Access other controls

## Workflow Tips

### For Drawing/Tracing

1. Position the video where you want it
2. Set your desired opacity (30-50% works well)
3. Press **L** to lock
4. Draw in your app — clicks go through the video
5. Press **L** again to unlock and reposition

### For Comparison Work

1. Arrange your work window and Reframer side by side
2. Lock Reframer so you can interact with your work
3. Use global shortcuts (**⌘ Page Up/Down**) to step frames

### Quick Toggle

The global shortcut **⌘ Shift L** lets you toggle lock from any app without switching to Reframer first.
