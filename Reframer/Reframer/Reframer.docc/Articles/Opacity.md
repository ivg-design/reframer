# Opacity

Blend the video overlay with your workspace.

## Overview

Adjust the video transparency to see both the reference footage and your work underneath. Lower opacity makes the video more transparent; higher opacity makes it more solid.

## Adjusting Opacity

### Slider

Drag the opacity slider in the control bar. The slider ranges from nearly transparent (2%) to fully opaque (100%).

### Numeric Input

For precise control:

1. Click the opacity percentage field
2. Type a value from 2 to 100
3. Press **Enter**

Arrow keys while focused:

- **↑ / ↓** — Step by 1%
- **Shift + ↑ / ↓** — Step by 10%

## Opacity Range

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 2% | Nearly invisible, just a hint of the video |
| 25% | Very transparent, easy to see through |
| 50% | Balanced blend of video and background |
| 75% | Video dominant, background faintly visible |
| 100% | Fully opaque, no transparency |

## Minimum Opacity

The minimum is 2% rather than 0% to ensure you can always see the video enough to adjust it back.

## Use Cases

- **Tracing** — Set 30-50% to draw over the video
- **Comparison** — Set 50% to see both reference and work equally
- **Quick reference** — Set 80-100% when you need to see the video clearly
- **Background guide** — Set 15-25% for subtle reference while working
